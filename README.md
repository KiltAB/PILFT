# PILFT
This is the image matching platform we made, which can complete the matching of large viewing angle weak texture images.
## Terms of Use
The algorithms included in the image matching platform include SIFT, SURF, ORB, ASIFT, LoFTR, and PILFT. The matching function can be realized by importing the left and right images and clicking each algorithm button. The resulting matching points annotated in the images have all been corrected by RANSAC.
