# PILFT
This is our image matching platform based on various image matching algorithms,it can complete the matching of various complex scene images.
## Terms of Use
The algorithms included in the image matching platform include SIFT, SURF, ORB, ASIFT, LoFTR, and PILFT. The matching function can be realized by importing the left and right images and clicking each algorithm button.

The resulting matching points annotated in the images have all been corrected by RANSAC.After obtaining the matching results, the number of matching points, the correct rate, the root mean square error and the homography matrix between the two images can be calculated.
